Glide/DirectX implementation on D3D11/12

<li>
<ul>-Play your old Glide and DirectX games even on the latest, modern version of Windows.</ul>
<ul>-Good compatiblity with the original libraries, I think.</ul>
<ul>-You can force the resolution and even MSAA for both Glide and DirectX which can really improve the appearance of games with hardwired low-resolution support.</ul>
<ul>-Support for hw/driver compatibility with some really old videocards like GF4 Ti4800 and ATI Radeon 8500 is also available for rare games needing it</ul>
<ul>-You can force windowed appearance and simple color-management and dithering (retro feeling) as postprocess effects</ul>
<ul>-For really old games running at their original low resolution you can upscale the image with various resampling filters like bicubic and lanczos</ul>
<ul>-You get a lot of configurable elements, either through the GUI CPL app or manually with a texteditor, if you know what you are doing</ul>
